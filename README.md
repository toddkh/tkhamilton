# tkhamilton

1. Download this repo's zip archive [here](https://github.com/f12/tkhamilton/archive/master.zip).

2. Extract the contents of the `tkhamilton-master` directory to your desired new/empty repo directory on your own machine.

3. If you have not yet created the organization and application for your site in [paradigm-ui](http://paradigm-ui.f12.global), go ahead and create them.  You will need your site's application id, application secret, and organization id for the next step.  You can obtain and copy this information as needed by viewing your application and organization in [paradigm-ui](http://paradigm-ui.f12.global) and clicking the `COPY` buttons.

4. Run `npm install` from within the new repo directory and you will eventually be prompted with a series of questions about the new brand.  The relevant files will be automatically updated with the information you provide.  **Note:** On Windows (Git Bash) you may have to manually end the prompts when finished (press CTRL+C).

5. Start coding!  Good places to start:
  - README.md (This file. You might want to update/remove it.)
  - src/components/App.js
  - src/components/layoutComponents
  - src/themes/basic

  **Tip:** This boilerplate uses [`paradigm-site-components`](https://github.com/f12/paradigm-site-components) extensively.  See its README for more information on how its standardized components are used.
